# LaTeX Reports

To compile all reports, run:

```console
$ ./compile.sh
```

The resulting PDF files will be placed in the `build` directory. To compile a subset of the reports,
their names can be added after the name of the script:

```console
$ ./compile.sh RelatorioFase1.tex
```

To detect formatting errors in reports, the following command can be executed:

```console
$ ./format.sh
```
